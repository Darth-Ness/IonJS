# IonJS
IonJS is a backend framework (like NextJS). But unlike NextJS IonJS is designed to be lightweight. It does this by prioritizing HTML over JS. IonJS aims to simplify development without making the ```node_modules``` folder huge and without shipping over a MB to the browser. It's recommended to pair IonJS with frontend JS and CSS libraries.

# Why?
There is several reasons why it's important to favor HTML over JS, despite what's popular at the moment. HTML lasts longer. If you wrote a site in plain HTML, and don't touch it for five years, you could load up the site and it work just fine. Where as if you had used a typical JS framework, it's very likely your site would not work anymore. At the very least it'd be very difficult to get it to run. Second it's very fast. Why? Well it doesn't ship tons of code to the browser, only the code you write.
